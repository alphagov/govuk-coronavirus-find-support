      <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by the Cabinet Office, working with:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government</li>
        <li>the Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs</li>
        <li>the Department for Work & Pensions</li>
        <li>the National Health Service (NHS)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll use the personal information you provide through this service to help make sure that people with a medical condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to coronavirus get the support they need.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll also use it to check your needs against data provided to us by the NHS, and to contact you with further advice or information.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This privacy notice covers:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the online service, where you can enter the information that we need to get support to you where you live</li>
        <li>the automated telephone service, where you can provide the same information over the phone</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Lawful basis for processing your personal information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we are processing this information on the basis that we’re carrying out a task in the public interest and to protect the vital interests of people more vulnerable to coronavirus.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This lawful basis applies to:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>information shared with us by the NHS</li>
      <li> provided to us through the online service or the automated telephone service</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Some of the information we hold is sensitive health and care information. This is classed as ‘special category’ personal data within the meaning of Schedule 1 to the Data Protection Act 2018, meaning we must state a further lawful basis for processing it. We’re also relying on substantial public interest and governmental purpose to process this information.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">When you submit information through the online service or the automated telephone service, we will compare your information to information shared with us by the NHS.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We ask for information about you and those who are supporting you through the online service and the automated telephone service. We may ask for more information as part of your subsequent interactions with the service.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll share relevant parts of your information with other government departments, NHS bodies, local authorities and other public sector and private sector organisations - depending on what’s necessary to get people the support they need.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We may share your personal information with other public sector bodies in order to make sure that we and they have accurate data on who is vulnerable to coronavirus and to make sure we get help to the people who need it.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We may share your personal information (except for confidential health and care information) with trusted supermarkets and other suppliers, so they can prioritise your orders if you have indicated that you need help getting basic supplies.</p>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will only keep your personal information for as long as we need it:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>to make sure that you get the support you need if you are a person with a medical condition which makes you vulnerable</li>
        <li>to make sure this service is meeting overall demand from vulnerable people</li>
        <li>to help with the overall government response to coronavirus</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is processed and stored</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">Your personal data may be transferred outside the UK while being processed by the Cabinet Office. If this happens, we’ll make sure you’re given the same level of technical and legal data protection as you are within the UK.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">We’re committed to doing all that we can to keep your information secure.
