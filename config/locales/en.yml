      <p class="govuk-body">Some of this information is sensitive health and care information. This is classed as special category personal data, meaning we must have a further lawful basis for processing it. So we’re also relying on substantial public interest and governmental purpose to process this data.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If we need to get your explicit permission to process information, our legal basis is consent.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we do with your information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll share relevant parts of your information with other government departments, NHS bodies, local authorities and other public sector and private sector organisations - depending on what’s necessary to get you the support you need.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We may share your personal information with other public sector bodies in order to make sure we and they have accurate data on who is vulnerable to coronavirus and to make sure we get help to the people who need it.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We may share your personal information (except for confidential health and care information) with supermarkets, so they can prioritise you for ‘click and collect’ orders.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Otherwise, we’ll only share your information if required to do so by law. For example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we keep your information</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We will only keep your personal information for as long as:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we need it to make sure you get the support you as part of the government response to coronavirus</li>
        <li>we need it to ensure the service for vulnerable people is meeting</li>
        <li>overall demand to respond to coronavirus</li>
        <li>the law requires us to</li>
